## Research

My research embraces <strong>theoretical and applied statistics</strong>, with  strong emphasis in <strong>Bayesian methods</strong>, computational statistics, and applications in fields such as biostatistics, economics, genomics, and sports analytics.<br><br>


## Teaching, supervision, and consultancy      

I supervise masterâ€™s and PhD students and collaborate internationally with universities like [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr/),
and the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). I am also involved in various statistical consulting projects, particularly in the health and business sectors.

I teach courses of 'Advanced Statistics', 'Statistical and Machine Learning', and 'Bayesian Statistics'.

I am an active member of the [Italian Statistical Society (SIS)](https://www.sis-statistica.it/) and the [International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA)](https://bayesian.org/). 
I am the deputy chair of the [ISI Special Interest Group in Sports Statistics](https://www.isi-web.org/committee/special-interest-group-sports-statistics).
